# Welcome!

Amit Awasthi, PhD, is an Associate Professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies. His research primarily focuses on atmospheric sciences, with an emphasis on air quality, climate change, extreme weather events, and exposure studies.

Dr. Awasthi has extensively investigated the impact of agricultural crop residue burning on air quality and public health in India. Notably, his studies have examined how emissions from burning wheat and rice stubble affect ambient air quality and respiratory health, particularly among children and young adults. For instance, his research published in *Science of the Total Environment* explored the effects of exposure to rice-crop residue burning smoke on pulmonary functions and oxygen saturation levels in humans.

In addition to his work on biomass burning, Dr. Awasthi has contributed to understanding the characteristics and sources of particulate matter (PM). His collaborative research has involved source characterization and apportionment of PM₁₀, PM₂.₅, and PM₀.₁ using techniques like Positive Matrix Factorization, as detailed in *Aerosol and Air Quality Research*. Furthermore, he has investigated sampling artifacts associated with PM₂.₅ in filter-based samplers, aiming to improve the accuracy of air quality measurements.

Dr. Awasthi has also explored the impacts of heatwaves and the urban heat island effect on mortality rates. His review article in *Urban Climate* systematically examined heatwave impacts on mortality and urban heat islands from 2000 to 2022, providing insights into the escalating challenges posed by extreme heat events in urban settings.

Through his interdisciplinary research, Dr. Awasthi contributes significantly to the understanding of environmental factors affecting air quality and public health, particularly in the context of climate change and urbanization.
